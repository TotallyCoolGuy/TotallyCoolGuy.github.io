        <p>We’re strong believers in getting visual at IDEO.org, and drawing is a great way to learn from the people you’re designing for. Whether it’s you with the pen or them, a quick sketch, a graph, or a timeline is a fantastic way to bridge language barriers and keep a record of your research. Drawing can also help the person you’re designing for organize her thoughts visually and generally spur ideas and conversation in a different way than talking. For example, you may ask someone to draw everything they spend money on in a week, or map out all the jobs they’ve had, or show you the route they take to their job. And remember, you don’t need to be a great artist for drawing to be a highly useful tool.</p>

      <div id="n1" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">1:Make sure you have pen and paper handy when talking with the people you’re designing for. Even a sheet torn out of your notebook works great. </div>
      <div id="n2" class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6">2:When you want the person you’re designing for to draw something, give them a clear idea of what you’re after. A map of their daily route? A timeline of their annual income? What percentage of their fields are dedicated to a certain crop? </div>

        <div id="n4" class="col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-sm-6">4:You can use the drawings as Conversation Starters. This Method can get you to a deeper understanding of the person you’re designing for so investigate what they’ve drawn.
